# Mars-Lander
My work on the Mars Lander summer project, given by the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge

Have a look at the pdf "Mars Lander Submission Summary" file within this repository to see what exactly I added to the project. Unfortunately, the competition hosts had received many submissions and accidentally missed mine, despite several follow-up emails. 

However ultimately, I enjoyed spending time on this project and learned a lot about the Mars Lander, C++ and OpenGL!
