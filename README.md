# Mars-Lander
My work on the Mars Lander summer project, given by the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge

Have a look at the pdf submission file within this repository to see what I added to the project more specifically. Unfortunately, the project wasn't actually submitted for the competition because the competition hosts had received many submissions and had accidentally overlooked mine. 

I enjoyed spending time on this project and learned a lot about C++ and OpenGL!
